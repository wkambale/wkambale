# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Wes

**Machine Learning Engineer | AI Community Leader | Technical Educator**

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer passionate about building production-ready ML systems for the African market.

With experience in TensorFlow, Keras, and Python-based workflows, I help teams bridge the gap between machine learning research and real-world deploymentâ€”especially on resource-constrained devices.

I'm also a [Google Developer Expert in AI](https://g.dev/kambale). I regularly speak at tech conferences including PyCon Africa, DevFest Kampala, DevFest Nairobi, and also write technical articles on AI/ML here [kambale.dev](https://kambale.dev).
